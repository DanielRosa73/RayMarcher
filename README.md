```make clean```
```make```
```./raymarcher```

## Features

### Primitive Shapes

This raymarch can render:
- Spheres
- Cubes
- Planes
- Tori


### Complex Shapes 

By combining the previously mentioned shapes's signed distance functions, this raymarcher can produce complex models like:
- Cube with a spherical hole
- Cube frame
- Peanut shape
